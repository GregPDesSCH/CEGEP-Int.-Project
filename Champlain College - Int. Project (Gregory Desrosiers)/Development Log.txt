The Desrosiers Mechanics Teaching Tool - Development Log

February 21, 2014
All abstract classes and core class files have been created without any algorithm entry.

February 22, 2014
Access modifiers for the abstract classes changed.

February 23 - 28, 2014
Falling behind schedule on development, but lack of development done because of tasks
to be done outside development.

February 28, 2014
All subclasses of the abstract classes, without any algorithm entries, for the 
programTopicComponents package have been created and saved in the src directory.

March 1, 2014
All classes of the commonClasses subpackage of the programTopicComponents package
have been defined. Comment blocks are added to all classes except to subclasses of the
abstract classes for all subpackages of the programTopicComponents package except the
commonClasses subpackage.

March 3, 2014
Rough build of HighScoreEntry class constructed, with a test done to make sure the
time format method works properly (a printf statement is needed to print it properly.)

March 4, 2014
All subclasses of AverageAcceleration, AverageVelocity, InstantaneousAcceleration, and
InstantaneousVelocity, are complete. The initial code for the equals and toString methods
are placed in all other subclasses of the equation classes to be used for this project.

March 6, 2014
Major code for the other classes in the motionInAStraightLine subpackage of the
programTopicComponents package is in place. Some classes in the motionInTwoandThreeDimensions
subpackage have code put in place as well. Comments are not yet completed and must be fixed.

March 7, 2014
All documentation comments in the motionInAStraightLine subpackage set. Major code added
to some classes in the motionInTwoandThreeDimensions subpackage.

March 8, 2014 - March 9, 2014
Major Code for the rest of the classes in the motionInTwoandThreeDimensions subpackage
put in place. Comments missing and therefore must be completed another time.

March 9, 2014
Major Code for all classes in the forcesAndMotion subpackage put in place. Subclasses
of CircularOrbitSpeed, OrbitalPeriodOfCircularOrbit, and UniversalGravitationalForce have
code entered as well. Comments still incomplete and must be in place.

March 10, 2014
Major Code for all classes in newtonLaws subpackage put in place. Because GravityAcceleration
and its subclasses involve almost the same equation as the gravitational field vector, where
it is coded in such a way that represents exact gravitational acceleration, those classes
have been removed from the project. All of the major code for the classes in the gravity
and staticEquilibrium subpackages now in place. Comments incomplete.

March 10, 2014 - March 11, 2014
Constructors for other classes in the programTopicComponents package in place except for the
major code. Some major code put in place for several classes in the workEnergyAndPower subpackage.
Comments still incomplete.

March 11, 2014
Constructors put in place for classes in the menuBars and dialogs subpackages of the guiComponents
package. Comments still not in place.

March 12, 2014
Major code put in place for all classes in the conservationOfEnergy subpackage and several
different classes in other incomplete packages: NucleiActivity, AngularFrequency, and
OscillationFrequency.

March 13 - March 14, 2014
Major code put in place for all classes in the nuclearPhysics and rotationalMotion subpackages.

March 16, 2014
Data fields put in place for all abstract classes of the programTopicComponents package to be 
worked on. Comments still not put in place.

March 21, 2014
A rough build of the debugging utility is complete. It's not finished, but it will come later.
Comments still not put in place.

March 25, 2014
Two rough builds of the menus going along the menu bars have been made. Not tested. For simplicity,
a general class for the actions involving the menu buttons has been made. Comments not in place.

March 27, 2014
Rough builds have been created for the other menus that go with the menu bars. Associated actions
and their mnemonics are put in place, except for what the action will do when they are clicked
by the mouse pointer. Comments are not in place.

March 28, 2014
All menus have been tested. Time has been taken to see if some of the generated code used to
lay out the components from NetBeans' WYSIWYG editor on a panel, and it results that it does
work. After a few modifications, the panel will be displayed exactly as a frame with a panel
that have its components laid out graphically.

March 29, 2014 - April 2, 2014
Panels for the modes and the dialogs have been created. Comments in place for only the necessary
classes to be used in this project. Panels not yet tested.

April 3, 2014 - April 5, 2014
Logo for the entire program has been created. Logos for programmer and college have been retrieved.
Panels tested and ready for assembly. Material for these panels to be used is not yet in place.

April 6, 2014 - April 7, 2014
A rough animation sequence of the credits roll has been created. JAVA logo missing, and the major
panels have not been put together yet. The subject material still has to be continuted before it
can be programmed in the build accordingly.

April 8, 2014
A rough build of the splash screen, that will appear when the program starts loading up, has been
made. A few details have been changed for the credits.

April 15, 2014
A change has been made to the credits roll of the program.

April 16, 2014
A Main Menu panel has been created. All the comments automatically created on the panels designed
must be changed. The program is not yet put together and tested for one chapter.

April 17 - 18, 2014
Some code of the Main Menu Panel has been pasted and modified. Part of the material to be used in
the program has been made as well.

April 19, 2014
The code for the panels have been put in place onto Eclipse, with a few modifications to avoid
compiler errors and confusing variable names. The panels are not yet tested, and the subject material
to be incorporated into the program is not complete.

April 20, 2014
Rough assembly of the entire program has been made. The popup menus are not yet added, and there is
still subject material to be completed. Code must be simplified, and there has to be extensive
testing on the program for all possible cases.

April 21, 2014
Popup menus still not constructed, but a few changes have been made, particularly with the creation
of a new package to set the actionPerformed method in instances of MenuBarAction through neighboring
classes. Some listeners are programmed. A lot of material to be programmed into the tool is missing.
Some started code for the menu bar listeners has been put in place.

The credits thread problem has been fixed, and additional info is on the credits file.

April 22, 2014 - April 23, 2014
More of the subject material to be programmed into the tool has been written out. A few fixes have been made.
An attempt was made to simplify the way on how to get the listeners respond to events from the
drop-down menus, but was a failure. Listeners are in progress.

April 24, 2014
A label has been created for dialogs because it will be used in JOptionPane methods. Credits utility created
and some listener code has been put in place. A look has been done over the material to be used in the
lecture involving what a student in physics needs to learn either before or at the same time.
Credits animation sequence fixed, some comments have been put in place, and a few adjustments have been
made to eliminate unnecessary code.

April 25, 2014
Panels for the simulations have been created, along with the appropriate tool tip texts. Some classes
have been created to reference the simulations, and some packages have been created as well
for more organization.

April 26, 2014 - April 27, 2014
Two simulations have been mostly programmed. Document listeners have been created to limit entries to
decimal numbers and whole numbers, and some work has been done with the animation, listeners, and other
corrections.

April 28, 2014
The rest of the two simulations have been programmed. No testing has been done, however, and no lecture
notewriting has been made as well.

April 29 - May 2, 2014
A few bugs have been fixed, but not much progress with the lectures have been made. At this point, it's 
too late to create visuals for the lectures. A discrepancy has been discovered with the simulation for 
Chapter 2 Section 6.

May 3, 2014
The discrepancy of the time frame for the animation task in the simulation of Chapter 2 Section 6 has
been fixed. Also, the listeners and the features of the simulation of Chapter 2 Section 1 has been fixed,
particularly with the issues regarding the unit vector button, magnitude, direction, and synchronizing
values with the GUI. The testing document has been prepared so that way people interested in testing
will follow it and take note for what to test and what errors have been found that will be fixed
once the project presentation is finished. The lecture selection listener has been fixed also.

May 4, 2014
Listeners have been fixed, the text for the lectures is in progress, and certain things are now in place.
The lectures must be finished, and the code must be cleaned up and organized for presentation. It must
be reviewed for how the project is to be delivered.

May 5, 2014
Quick lectures are now in place for the program. Modification of the loading utility in place. Review for
project demo presentation and possible modifications of the code with comments expected.

May 6, 2014
Demo presentation complete.

May 13, 2014
Comments and descriptions added to classes that have not been described properly as of yet.
